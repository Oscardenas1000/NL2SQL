## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please let us know **privately** as soon as possible so we can address it before it’s publicly disclosed.

You can report issues via one of these two channels:

1. **GitHub**: Open a private security [issue](https://github.com/Oscardenas1000/NL2SQL/issues)

Please include as much information as you can, such as:
- A description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce (ideally with proof-of-concept code)  
- The impact or scope of the issue

## Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**  
   We aim to respond within 48 hours of receiving your report.  
2. **Investigation**  
   We’ll validate and assess the impact, and may follow up for more details.  
3. **Fix & Release**  
   A fix will be prepared in a private branch and merged into the next patch release.  
4. **Public Disclosure**  
   Once a patched version is available, we’ll post a public advisory on GitHub and update this file.
